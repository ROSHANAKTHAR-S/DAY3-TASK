Different between WINDOW, SCREEN, and DOCUMENT IN Javascript:


DOCUMENT:
•	It is represent any HTML document or web page is loaded in browser.
•	It is loaded inside the window.
•	Document object mode are img[], layer[], links[], forms[].
•	The document object represents the whole HTML document as a tree of objects (HTML, HEAD, BODY, <>TAGS).
•	All the tags, element with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
•	We can access the document from a window  using the window.document.
•	Ex: document.open ()create a blank document within the window.
PROPERTY:
1.	BODY:  It return the content of the body element.
2.	FORMS:  It return all the element of the form.
3.	TITLE:  It return the title element of the document.
4.	HEAD:  It return the head element of the document.
5.	IMAGES:   It return the collection of <img>  elements in the document.
6.	LINK:  It return all <a> elements that have a href attribute.

WINDOW:
•	It represent a javascript browser that displays the contents of the webpage.
•	It is the very first object that is loaded in he browser.
•	Browser object model (window) are frames, history, location, screen.
•	The window is the part of browser object model not document object model.
•	We can access the window from window only.
•	Function, variables of javascript are member of the window object.
•	Ex: window.open() open a window.
Property:
1.	CONSOLE:  It return a reference to the console object  which provide access to the browser debugging console.
2.	FRAMES:  It represent an array that contains all the frames of a widow.
3.	LENGTH:  It represent the number of frames in the current window.
4.	CLOSED: Boolean value that represent whether the window is closed or not.

screen:
> Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions .
> It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. 
> It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object.
> It can be written without window prefix.

1.screen properties width and height are the full screen.

2.screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar.

> The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript,
  which is potentially confusing because we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about 
  interactions with the operating system. 
  The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right
  properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.
